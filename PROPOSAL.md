The project I would like to do is to recreate the game 2048. I have experience with the game because
I used to play it a lot with my sister, so I thought it would be fun and simple enough that I could
actually accomplish recreating it. I have played many rounds and reached 2048 multiple times, so my background 
knowledge mostly consists of what I know from playing. After ideal gas, I think I could figure out how to recreate the
visuals while I still think it seems like a fun but decent challenge for me.

By the end of week 1, I will have set up the basis of the project and started implementing the basic structure of the
game engine. By the end of week 2, I will have researched and fully implemented the game logic and starting displaying 
the visuals. By the end of week 3, I will have finalized the visuals and added details to show each combination of
boxes and the score.

If I were to finish the project early, some stretch goals I could implement include options for different variations of 
the game, such as 3D and 4D versions of the game with multiple boards at once, with different images representing each
number block, or bigger board sizes so the game moves faster.
